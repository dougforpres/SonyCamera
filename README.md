Windows DLL Connecting to Sony Camera via USB

1st draft of README

This DLL allows an application to connect to a compatible Sony DSLR/Mirrorless camera.
Individual camera settings (Properties) can be retrieved and updated.
Images can be taken and retrieved.

This software was developed primarily for Astrophotography purposes, and a companion project ASCOMSonyCameraDriver provides a basic ASCOM Driver.

This is the first c++ code I've written since 2005/2006, so please don't judge me :)
